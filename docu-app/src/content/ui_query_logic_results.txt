Query Logic & Results


Result Display Limits

When a Beacon is deployed following Production Implementation (PI), it enforces a maximum limit of 100 records per dataset in the query response. This implies that, although a dataset may contain more than 100 matching records, only the first 100 are returned and displayed in the Results detailed table.
To make this clear to users, an informative message is shown in the modal: This message is displayed only when the dataset returns more records than the limit configured by the Beacon.
If the total number of matching records is within the configured limit, then all records are displayed.
