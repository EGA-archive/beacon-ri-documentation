Beacon v2 Reference/Production Implementation Documentation


Beacon v2 Reference Implementation (B2RI) and Beacon v2 Production Implementation (B2PI) are tools that provide a REST API and enable queries of genomic and phenotypic data in compliance with Beacon v2 standard.

Below is an overview of the schema process of B2RI/B2PI, which involves transforming raw data into a Beacon v2-compliant .json format, uploading it to the API and querying the API through a user-friendly interface.

The process relies on the following four processes:

Beacon RI Tools v2. This tool enables conversion of .csv/.vcf files to .json files in a Beacon Friendly Format (BFF). Note that Beacon RI Tools v2 are designed to work with both Beacon 2 RI API or Beacon 2 PI API. Specifically, it includes all the features that are needed for generating Beacon v2 PI API compatible data.
Beacon RI API / PI API. The API connects to a MongoDB database that stores the .json files, allowing one to query the data following the Beacon v2 standards. Beacon v2 PI is an upgraded version of Beacon v2 RI API, developed for production environments and recommended for improved performance and user experience.
Beacon Verifier v2. A tool that checks that the data in the API is compliant with Beacon v2 and provides a verification report.
Beacon User Interface. The user-friendly interface for querying the API without needing to worry about the underlying standards. It supports intuitive queries and enables authentication through LifeScience or Keycloak.
Regarding security, the API always validates authentication through the chosen identity provider, following the globally accepted OIDC and Oauth protocols.

As stated before, Beacon v2 PI API is a beacon instance for production environments. The steps that this production instance follows are the next ones shown in the next flowchart:

The process to deploy and inject data is the same than in Beacon v2 RI API (data comes from Beacon RI Tools v2) but this instance is optimized and tested, having the next upgrades from Beacon v2 RI API:

Handlers of the endpoints are classes, not functions.
Unit testing has been developed for the application, starting with 108 unit tests that cover 4000 lines of code approximately (100%).
Concurrency testing has been applied for this new beacon instance, showing results of responses for more than 3 million genomic variants splitted in different datasets in less than 100 millisecs, for a total of 1000 requests made by 10 users per second at the same time.
Linking ids to a dataset in a yaml file is not needed anymore.
A couple more indexes for mongoDB have been applied, that, in addition to the restructuration of the code, have improved the quickness of the responses.
Authentication/Authorization is now applied as a decorator, not as a different container.
LOGS now show more relevant information about the different processes (from request to response) including transaction id, the time of execution of each function and the initial call and the return call.
Exceptions now are raised from the lower layer to the top layer, with information and status for the origin of the exception.
Architecture of the code is not dependent on a particular database, meaning that different types of databases (and more than one) can be potentially applied to this instance (although now only MongoDB is the one developed).
Parameters are sanitized.
Users can manage what entry types want their beacon to show by editing a manage conf file inside source (Endpoint Mapper).
