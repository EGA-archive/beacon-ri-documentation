Documentation Introduction Beacon Data Model
Understanding Beacon Data Model
The Beacon data model defines how genomic and related metadata are structured and connected within a Beacon. Rather than being a flat list of results, Beacon organizes information into clearly defined entry types such as Individuals, Biosamples, Analyses, Runs, Datasets, Cohorts, and Genomic Variations. Each entry type represents a real-world biological or technical concept, and together they form a structured, queryable ecosystem.
The schemas below provide both the architectural overview and the field-level detail needed to understand how Beacon structures data in a standardized and interoperable way.

Schema 1 - Conceptual relationships between Beacon entry types
Schema 1. Illustration of the conceptual relationships between the entry types that reflect the logical flow of biological data, from person to sample to variant. This demonstrates how, for example, an Individual can be linked to multiple Biosamples, how those biosamples are processed into Runs and Analyses, and how Genomic Variations are ultimately derived and stored within Datasets. Many of these relationships follow a one-to-many pattern; for instance, one Individual may have several Biosamples, and one Biosample may be associated with multiple Analyses.

Schema 2 - Structural breakdown of Beacon entry types
Schema 2. A detailed structural breakdown of the entry types outlining the fields and data types available within each, including which properties are mandatory and which are optional according to the Beacon v2 specification. This schema demonstrates what information can be stored, filtered, and returned through Beacon API queries. Of note, the Beacon v2 specification remains flexible, and it is up to the implementer to decide which entry types to use.
