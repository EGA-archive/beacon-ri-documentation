Documentation Reference Implementation Introduction

Reference Implementation

Introduction

Beacon Reference Implementation (B2RI) is provided as an example implementation of the Beacon v2 specification. Its primary purpose is to illustrate how the standard can be implemented in practice and to support understanding, experimentation, and early prototyping.
Reference Implementation is not actively maintained and will not receive further feature development or long-term support. As such, it should not be considered production-ready or relied upon for ongoing deployments.
The Beacon v2 Production Implementation (B2PI) is a separate software designed specifically for production environments.
It offers improved performance and full alignment with the Beacon v2 specification. B2PI is actively developed and maintained and is recommended for all new and existing production deployments.

Transitioning from B2RI to B2PI

The transition from B2RI to B2PI is primarily a matter of data and deployment, as the two implementations are not directly compatible. While data generated for B2PI can be adapted for use with B2RI, the reverse is not supported. Since RI and PI are different software systems, transitioning requires updating the deployment by removing the Reference Implementation container and rebuilding the service using the Production Implementation, following the B2PI deployment documentation.
Detailed instructions for deploying B2PI can be found here.
