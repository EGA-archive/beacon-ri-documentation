Filtering Terms

Extract filtering terms
To automatically fill in the filtering terms endpoint and be able to apply the ontologies that are found inside your data to query your beacon, please execute the next script:
docker exec beaconprod python beacon/connections/mongo/extract_filtering_terms.py

Manually adding filtering terms (optional)
To manually add filtering terms to your beacon, execute the following command in MongoDB for the `libraryStrategy` field in the `runs` collection:

```bash
db.filtering_terms.insertMany([{
  "type": "alphanumeric",
  "id": "libraryStrategy",
  "scope": ["runs"]
}])
```
Get descendant and semantic similarity terms (optional)
If you have the ontologies loaded and the filtering terms extracted*, you can automatically get their descendant and semantic similarity terms by following the next two steps: Add your .obo files inside ontologies naming them as the ontology prefix in lowercase (e.g. ncit.obo) and rebuild the beacon container with:
Run the following script:

docker exec beaconprod python beacon/connections/mongo/get_descendants.py
