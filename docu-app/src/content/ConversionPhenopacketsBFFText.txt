Beacon RI Tools v2
Conversion from Phenopackets to BFF


This option will convert a Phenopacket v2 into Beacon Friendly Format Biosamples and Individuals models while preserving as much information as possible.
For detailed information about the mapping of properties between Phenopackets and Beacon schemas, please refer to this spreadsheet: Beacon + Phenopackets Schemas.
Most of the mapping between the Phenopackets and Beacon models was straightforward. However, some fields in the Phenopacket schema did not have a direct match in the Beacon schema.
Fields containing important metadata that could not be mapped to a specific Beacon property were stored in the additionalInformation (notes) field to preserve as much information as possible.
Specific Mappings
Individuals.diseases.notes:
The following Phenopacket fields related to diseases were saved in the notes field:
resolution
primary_site
laterality
excluded
Individuals.info:
The file.individual_to_file_identifiers field from Phenopackets is saved in the info property of the Beacon individual.
Biosamples.notes:
The biosamples.description field is stored in the notes field of the Beacon biosample.
Handling collectionData
The biosamples.timeOfCollection property in Phenopackets supports various data types, including:
gestationalAge: Measure of the age of a pregnancy
Age: Age as an ISO8601 duration (e.g., P40Y10M05D)
AgeRange: Age within a given range
OntologyClass: Age as an ontology class
Timestamp: Specific date and time
TimeInterval: Time interval
In contrast, the Beacon schema defines biosamples.collectionDate as the "Date of biosample collection in ISO8601 format" and expects a simple string.
To maximize data retention, the tool converts the collectionData from Phenopackets to a string and stores it in the collectionDate property of Beacon. While this approach does not fully align with the intended collectionDate field usage, it ensures valuable data is not lost.
Converting data from phenopackets
To convert a phenopacket into Biosamples and Individuals schemas first save the phenopacket in this folder: phenopackets-to-BFF.
And then run:
docker exec phenopackets-to-BFF python working-w-phenopackets.py /usr/src/app/examples/phenopacket.json
Bear in mind that the path /usr/src/app/examples must remain unchanged.
You'll find your BFFs in the same folder where you saved the phenopacket, phenopackets-to-BFF.
