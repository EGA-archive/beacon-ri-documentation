Test Data
This section contains test datasets you can use to explore and validate the functionalities of the Beacon v2 Implementation.

Dataset 1: CINECA Synthetic Cohort EUROPE UK1
Dataset name: CINECA_synthetic_cohort_EUROPE_UK1
Origin: Derived from EGAD00001006673 (EGA) and a raw file with phenoclinic data kindly donated to us from our CINECA-EU partners.
Study size: 2504 samples with genetic data (low coverage WGS) based on 1000 Genomes data (phase3 and Geuvadis), and 76 synthetic subject attributes and phenotypic data derived from UKBiobank.

In support of FAIRness in data sharing, this dataset is made freely available under the Creative Commons Licence (CC-BY). Please ensure this preamble is included with this dataset and that the CINECA project (funding: EC H2020 grant 825775) is acknowledged.

Dataset 2: Rare Disease Synthetic Dataset
Dataset name: Rare Disease Synthetic Dataset
Origin: Derived from EGAD00001008392 (EGA).
Study size: 18 whole genome samples (6 index cases with their parents) created with public human genomic background combined with in-silico insertion of real disease-causing variants.

Dataset name: Dataset with synthetic data for beacon testing
Origin: All the metadata inserted is synthetic.
Study size: 20 female samples with breast carcinoma.

Dataset 5: genomicVariations CSVs
You can load genomicVariations data into Beacon using either a VCF file or a CSV. Here you’ll find two genomicVariations CSVs examples, one representing variants with caseLevelData information and the second one with variantLevelData.
caseLevelData: Describes which biosamples carry which variants. This is sample-level information based on individual analyses.
variantLevelData: Describes the variants themselves, without linking them to specific individuals. This is aggregate-level information, such as genomic position, alleles, frequency or phenotype associated.

Included files
File/Folder	Description	Where to find
caseLevelData folder	genomicVariations CSV with the mandatory fields of the model and the caseLevelData properties.	caseLevelData
variantLevelData folder	genomicVariations CSV with the mandatory fields of the model and the variantLevelData properties.	variantLevelData

Note: You can include either or both blocks in your Beacon instance. Combining both gives you a richer model that supports individual-level queries and population-level insights.
