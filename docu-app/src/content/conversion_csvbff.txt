Before getting the BFF (json) final documents, please make sure your conf.py, that you will find inside the conf folder, is reading the right CSV document.


Now you can execute the next bash command from the root folder in your terminal (for the collection you have chosen in the configuration file, ie. cohorts collection):
$ docker exec -it ri-tools python cohorts_csv.py
All the possible scripts you can execute (individually) to convert CSV data for each collection are:
$ docker exec -it ri-tools python analyses_csv.py
$ docker exec -it ri-tools python biosamples_csv.py
$ docker exec -it ri-tools python cohorts_csv.py
$ docker exec -it ri-tools python datasets_csv.py
$ docker exec -it ri-tools python genomicVariations_csv.py
$ docker exec -it ri-tools python individuals_csv.py
$ docker exec -it ri-tools python runs_csv.py
Once you execute one of the scripts listed above, it will generate the final JSON files (BFF) in the output_docs folder with the name of the collection followed by the .json extension (e.g. cohorts.json).
These files will be able to be used in a mongoDB for beacon usage. To know how to import in a Beacon v2, please do as described in Beacon v2 RI api.
