Beacon RI Tools v2

Conversion from CSV to BFF

Before getting the BFF (json) final documents, please make sure your conf.py, which you will find inside the conf folder, is reading the right CSV document.

Now you can execute the next bash command from the root folder in your terminal.

If you want to convert all the CSV files you have at the same time, after saving them in the CSV input folder (see configuration head), just execute:

docker exec -it ri-tools python convert_csvTObff.py

On the other hand, you can convert one by one only, picking one of the following commands for the entry type you need:

docker exec -it ri-tools python analyses_csv.py

docker exec -it ri-tools python biosamples_csv.py

docker exec -it ri-tools python cohorts_csv.py

docker exec -it ri-tools python datasets_csv.py

docker exec -it ri-tools python genomicVariations_csv.py

docker exec -it ri-tools python individuals_csv.py

docker exec -it ri-tools python runs_csv.py

Once you execute any of the conversion scripts, it will generate the final JSON files (BFF) in the output_docs folder with the name of the collection followed by the .json extension (e.g., cohorts.json).

These files can be used in a MongoDB for beacon usage. To know how to import them into a Beacon v2, please follow the instructions described in Beacon v2 RI API.
