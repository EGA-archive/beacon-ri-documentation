Beacon UI
Configuration

Please first create a .env file inside the frontend folder so that you can modify some variables. 
Take into account that the file below will not be copied to GitHub as it contains keys and 
for security reasons it should be ignored:

```
REACT_APP_CLIENT_ID="ID of your LS Login"
REACT_APP_CLIENT_SECRET="password of your LS Login"
REACT_APP_KEYCLOAK_CLIENT_SECRET="password of your Keycloak login"
```

Tip: for Life Science environment, please first create a user (
[create a user](https://lifescience-ri.eu/ls-login/users/how-to-get-and-use-life-science-id.html)). 
After that you will need to register a service registry in order to be able to administrate your logins. 
Please go [here](https://services.aai.lifescience-ri.eu/spreg/) and ask for a New Service - type OIDC.

Then please edit the file [config.json](https://github.com/EGA-archive/beacon2-ri-api/blob/master/frontend/src/config.json). 
You need to decide where you want the UI to point to when making requests. 
Find below an example:

```
{
  "API_URL": "https://yourAPIdomain.com/beacon-network/v2.0.0",
  "REDIRECT_URL": "https://yourUIdomain.com",
  "KEYCLOAK_URL": "https://yourKEYCLOAKdomain.com"
}
```

Finally, please include the URL of your User interface to the file beacon/_main_.py (line 103), 
so that it becomes part of the list of URLs accepted by CORS.

**Note**: In the frontend folder you will find a file called .gitignore with the list of all files that need to be ignored.
