The Beacon2 RI tools v2 is a set of tools written in python in the next GitHub repository.

The main goal of Beacon RI tools v2.0 is to obtain the Beacon Friendly Format (BFF) files, that are JSON files following Beacon v2 official specifications. These files have the correct format and structure to be injected to a Beacon v2 mongoDB database. 

To obtain a Beacon v2 with its mongoDB and see how to inject the BFF files, you can check it out and download yours for free at the official GitHub repository of Beacon v2 RI api.

The Beacon data model consists of 7 collections; analyses, biosamples, cohorts, datasets, genomicVariations, individuals and runs. Therefore the Beacon RI tools v2.0 allows the user to create the different 7 BFF options.

To get the different BFF files, you can convert your data from a CSV file with a defined structure, following the Beacon data model, to BFF, for all the 7 collections. However, for the genomicVariations collection, you can either can convert your data from a CSV or from a VCF file, minimizing conversion time. 

The initial step, since the Beacon2 RI tools v2 can not convert the data from any source of data, one needs to populate the CSV templates that are built following the 7 collections of the Beacon data model that enables the Beacon2 RI tools v2 to convert from CSV to BFF. Note that you can find the CSV templates in the templates folder of the same repository.
