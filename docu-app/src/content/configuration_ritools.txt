In order to use Beacon2 RI tools v2 one needs to modify a configuration file with the desired files and options for the different collections.
You have to edit the configuration file conf.py that you will find inside conf. Inside this file you will find the next information:


#### Input and Output files config parameters ####
csv_filename='csv/examples/cohorts.csv'
output_docs_folder='output_docs/CINECA_dataset/'


#### VCF Conversion config parameters ####
num_variants=100000
reference_genome='GRCh37' # Choose one between NCBI36, GRCh37, GRCh38








Generic config parameters
The first part of this configuration only concerns the conversion of CSV to BFF only. It is used only when you are converting from CSV.
The csv_filename variable sets where the CSV file is and from where the script will read the data. This CSV file needs to have the headers written as you can find in the files inside templates. Note that any header that has a different name from the ones that appear inside the templates will not be read by the Beacon2 RI tools v2. The CSV must be inside the folder csv, and with the possibility to use subfolders inside it.


The output_docs_folder sets the folder where your final BFF (json files) will be saved once execution of beacon tools finishes. This folder is mandatory to be always inside output_docs, so only the subdirectory inside output_docs can be modified in this path.
VCF conversion config parameters
The second part of the configuration file pertains to the VCF to BFF conversion. This only needs to be used in case you are using a VCF as source for the genomic variants collection.

The num_variants is the variable you need to write in case you are executing the VCF conversor (genomicVariations_vcf.py). This will tell the script how many variants will be read and converted from the file(s). 
The reference_genome field is the genome used to map the reads. 
The allele_frequency field lets you set a threshold for the allele frequency (AF) of the variants you want to convert from the VCF file. If you set it at 0.5, all the variants with 0.5 or less AF will be converted to BFF. 1 is the default value (all variants will be converted).
