This deployment  just uses a bash script and a Makefile which won’t deploy the idp authentication service. If you wish to build the idp service you will have to go to Manual Deployment.

Cloning the repository

First of all, start by cloning the GitHub repository in your system.

git clone https://github.com/EGA-archive/beacon2-ri-api.git

Make sure the next list of ports are free of use in your system:
27017 → mongo
5050 → beacon
5051 → permissions

Execute start script from root

bash start.sh

If the operation is successful, you will have a beacon up and running in http://localhost:5050/api.
